        Tucked away along the shores of the Georgian Bay, this spectacular natural cave is the star attraction of the <a href="/tobermory/attractions/bruce-peninsula-national-park" target="_blank">Bruce Peninsula National Park</a>. Millions of years of wind, rain, and waves have carved a deep cavern into the limestone cliffs–a tranquil space to appreciate the unbound beauty of the bay. 
      </p>
      <p>
        A hit with young and old alike, its turquoise-tinged waters, calm interior pools, and rugged rocky coastline make the Grotto a must for anyone on a visit to the peninsula.  
      </p>

      <h2>
        Parking at the Grotto 
      </h2>
      <p>
        Its unbridled natural beauty has seen the Grotto become a little too big for its boots in recent years. And with limited parking available, you’ll need to plan ahead if you wish to visit during the peak season. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Daytrippers must use the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/P1+Daytime+Parking,+Tobermory,+ON+N0H+2R0,+Canada/@45.236097,-81.5248232,16.08z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1sGrotto+parking+lot!3m4!1s0x4d2d0624e21bc25f:0x67ffb33d90e63800!8m2!3d45.2363856!4d-81.5227644" target="_blank">P1 Daytime Parking</a> near Cyprus Lake. <a href="https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/pn-np/on/bruce/activ/experiences/grotto/parking" target="_blank">Advanced reservations</a> are available between May and October, which are split into four-hour slots to allow more people a chance to visit the cave. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Huge crowds of visitors are turned away during the peak summer season (July to August) and Canadian/American public holidays, so it’s essential to reserve a parking spot during these periods. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Parking costs $11.70 per vehicle plus a $6 reservation fee.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Campers staying at the Cyprus Lake camping grounds can park onsite and hike directly to the Grotto.  
      </p>

      <h2>
        Hiking to the Grotto
      </h2>
      <p>
        From the P1 Parking Lot or the Cyprus Lake campsites, you’ll have three options to reach the Grotto: the Horse Lake Trail, the Georgian Trail, and the Marr-Lake Trail. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The easiest and most direct route is the Georgian Trail, a 30-minute gravel path that meanders over a few gentle hills. The Bruce Trail section that straddles the shoreline requires climbing over slippery rocks and roots. 
      </p>
      <p>
        You’ll also need to scramble down a rugged 12-metre cliff to enter the cave–a challenge for small children and the elderly–although it’s possible to enjoy the views from up above.  
      </p>
      <p>
        On the way back, opt to return via the Marr Lake Trail or Horse Lake Trail for a change of scenery. These routes are slightly tougher, though they still have an easy rating. 
      </p>
