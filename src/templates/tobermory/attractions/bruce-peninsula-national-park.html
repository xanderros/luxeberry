        Lush forested trails, cragged limestone caves, and secluded lakeside campsites make Bruce Peninsula National Park one of the top tourist attractions in Ontario. Of course, it doesn’t hurt the hidden <a href="/tobermory/attractions/scuba-diving" target="_blank">underwater wrecks</a> of the <a href="/tobermory/attractions/fathom-five-national-marine-park" target="_blank">Fathom Five National Marine Park</a> are also within easy reach.
      </p>
      <p>
        And at just a stone’s throw from downtown Tobermory, a trip to the Bruce Peninsula is a must for anyone on vacation in the region. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The 156 km2 park lines the edge of the Niagara Escarpment, a UNESCO-listed Biosphere Reserve famed for its dramatic dolomite cliffs and thick forests of maple and pine. The glistening Georgian Bay and Lake Huron lie on either side to complete the majestic scene. 
      </p>
      <h2>
        Flora and Fauna in the Bruce Peninsula National Park
      </h2>
      <p>
        The Bruce Peninsula is teeming with plant life, especially in spring when 40 species of orchid hit full bloom.  Wildflowers, dwarf lake iris, and holly fern thrive between towering ancient cedars, while cliff-hanging trees and hardy evergreen flora straddles the shore. 
      </p>
      <p>
        You’ll encounter an abundance of wildlife here as well, with everything from chipmunks to porcupines, raccoons, and snow hares calling the peninsula home. Lucky campers might even stumble across a black bear or a massasauga rattlesnake.
      </p>
      <p>
        Birders should make a beeline for Cyprus Lake, where a wide range of migrant and breeding species flutter about. Upland Sandpiper, Scarlet Tanager, and Sandhill Crane are some of the spectacular avifauna on display. 
      </p>

      <h2>
        Hiking in the Bruce Peninsula National Park
      </h2>
      <p>
        Hiking is the pastime of choice at Bruce Peninsula National Park–hardly surprising, seeing as Ontario’s best scenery lies within.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Bruce Trail is the main route, which straddles the shore of the Georgian Bay to offer both lake and forest views. Doing the entire 28km trail– the longest and oldest in Canada–will take at least eight hours, from Little Cove Provincial Park to Crane Lake Lot. Several campsites are available enroute to break up the journey. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Shorter options for daytrippers include the Cyprus Lake Trail, the Horse Lake Trail, the Marr Lake Trail, and the Singing Sands Trail. Some are quite strenuous, so don’t expect hiking in the Bruce to be a walk in the park. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Drop into the Bruce Peninsula National Park and <a href="/tobermory/attractions/fathom-five-national-marine-park" target="_blank">Fathom Five National Marine Park</a> Visitor Centre in Tobermory to pay your park fees and enquire about specific routes. 
      </p>

      <h2>
        Where to go in the Bruce Peninsula National Park
      </h2>
      <p>
        The epicentre of the park is Lake Cyprus, a picturesque spot with campsites, parking lots, and numerous trailheads. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The park’s top attraction is <a href="/tobermory/attractions/the-grotto" target="_blank">the Grotto</a>–a cool limestone cave carved by millions of years of erosion. The clear turquoise waters of the Georgian Bay make this a prime spot to swim, while its grand interior cavern provides a welcome respite from the sun and the wind.
      </p>
      <p>
        The best way to get here is to take the Georgian Bay Trail from Cyprus Lake. This gentle 20-minute hike passes through thick forests and eventually requires a 12-metre scramble down a rocky open-air cliff. 
      </p>
      <p>
        To the east, you’ll find limestone cliffs and flowerpot formations at Indian Head Cove, another popular spot to swim. Head a few minutes further east to the lookout at Halfway Rock Point for sweeping views of <a href="/tobermory/attractions/flowerpot-island" target="_blank">Flowerpot Island</a> and the Georgian Bay. 
      </p>
      <p>
        To the west, a short walk leads you to the forest-fringed Boulder Beach. Head further west along the rocky Bruce Trail to reach the viewpoint at Overhanging Point–a tough hike but utterly worthwhile. 
      </p>
      <h2>
        Parking Near the Grotto
      </h2>
      <p>
        Daytrippers to the Grotto and its nearby sites must park at the P1 Daytime Parking Lot, which fills up during peak summer (July to August) and Canadian and American public holidays.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://reservation.pc.gc.ca/BrucePeninsula?Type=6&language=en&gccf=true" target="_blank">Reserve your parking spot</a> in advance to avoid missing out. 
      </p>

      <h2>
        Where to Stay in the Bruce Peninsula National Park
      </h2>
      <p>
        The best spot to base yourself is the quaint harbourside town of Tobermory, just a few minute's drive from the park. Luxury travelers should book a few nights at our <a href="/tobermory/cottage/tobermoryshores" target="_blank">opulent waterfront cottage</a>, which boasts top-end facilities and sweeping Georgian Bay views. 
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’d rather camp, then pitch a tent at either the Birches, Poplars, or Tamarack campgrounds alongside Cyprus Lake. Despite having over 200 drive-in sites, these fully book out in the summer so <a href="https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/pn-np/on/bruce/visit/reserv" target="_blank">reserve ahead</a>. You’ll pay $30 per night and get basic facilities like washrooms and potable water.

        Getting to Bruce Peninsula National Park
      </h2>
      <p>
        The Bruce Peninsula lies about 3.5 hours from downtown Toronto on Highway 6. The closest town is Tobermory, which serves as an excellent hub to explore the region. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="http://www.parkbus.ca/" target="_blank">Parkbus</a> runs a service to Tobermory during the warmer months from Toronto. Those coming from the north could take the <a href="http://www.ontarioferries.com/en/ms-chi-cheemaun-en/" target="_blank">M.S. Chi-Cheemaun ferry</a> from Manitoulin Island, which runs on weekends over the summer.
