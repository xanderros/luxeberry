        Located just 10 minutes from Grand Bend's <a href="/grand-bend/attractions/main-beach">Main Beach</a> yet seemingly a whole world away, Pinery Provincial Park is the perfect place to go for a soothing nature escape. Lush oak savannahs, rustic campgrounds, and wildlife-rich dunes abound, while ample hiking and biking trails let you explore the stunning expanse up close. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Wander down to the beach at sunset, and you'll be treated to one of the most spellbinding end-of-day-displays on Earth (top 10 sunsets in the world, according to Nat Geo).

      <h2>
        Swimming at Pinery Provincial Park
      </h2>
      <p>
        The Pinery Park Beach stretches a whopping 10km and is virtually deserted compared to Main Beach. It doesn't boast the same fine golden sand, however, with gravel and rocks scattered around certain sections.
      </p>
      <p>
        The waters here are usually calm and safe for small children to swim in. Keep a close eye on the weather, though, because Lake Huron can whip up wild waves and conditions can change at a moment's notice. Unlike Main Beach, you won't find any buoyed areas or lifeguards here. 
      </p>

        Flora and Fauna at Pinery Provincial Park
      </h2>
      <p>
        Pinery Provincial Park is a hit among outdoorsy types for its spectacular setting and wildlife-rich scenery. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Its 2,532 hectares are home to 757 species of plant, 325 types of bird, and 60 distinct butterfly, many of which you'll encounter firsthand. An array of mammals and reptiles also inhabit the space, albeit a little harder to see. For the best chance of spotting your favourite critters, embark on a stealthy early morning nature walk before the other campers have arisen. And remember, silence and patience are key. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Inland, you'll find a lush Oak Savannah ecosystem that only exists in a select few places on Earth. Closer to the beach, the landscape morphs into freshwater coastal sand dunes.

      <h2>
        Camping at Pinery Provincial Park
      </h2>
      <p>
        Pinery has over a thousand campsites spread across <a href="https://pinerypark.on.ca/day-use-and-camping/" target="_blank">three separate grounds</a>, with both electrical and non-electrical options available. Pull-through sites, trailer sanitation stations, barbeque facilities, showers, and flush toilets are available around the park. But despite the vast supply, these often book out during peak holiday periods; we recommend you reserve your spot in advance through <a href="https://reservations.ontarioparks.com/Pinery" target="_blank">Ontario Parks</a>.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Choose from one of the three following sites:  
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li class="list__item">The Riverside Campground resides in the southern section of the park near the Old Ausable Channel. It's open year-round and has electrical, non-electrical, and pull-through sites.</li>
        <li class="list__item">The Burley Campground straddles the south-western border of the park and is surrounded by forested pines. It's rather rustic, with no electrical or pull-through available. Burley is open between May and September and lies within easy walking distance of the beach. </li>
        <li class="list__item">The Dunes Campground resides near the visitor's centre, close to the beach and the outdoor amphitheatre. You'll find a mix of electric, tent, and pop-up trailer sites, which open between May and September. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Group sites for up to 35 campers are available near the day-use area.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Yurts and furnished campsites are also on offer, but you'll need to book them super early in peak periods.   
      </p>

        Hiking and Biking Pinery Provincial Park
      </h2>
      <p>
        Hiking is a popular thing to do at Pinery, with ten different nature trails traversing the park's distinct ecosystems. Each route is unique, from short 1 km stints to an epic 13 km trans-park foray. And if you're patient and quiet enough, there's a good chance you'll encounter some of the local wildlife along the way. Grab a map from the visitor's centre or download <a href="https://maps.me/download/" target="_blank">Maps.me</a> or <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/parks/canada/ontario/the-pinery-provincial-park" target="_blank">All Trails</a> to see the lay of the land.   
      </p>
      <p>
        Mountain biking is another fun outdoor activity here. There's <a href="https://www.singletracks.com/bike-trails/pinery-provincial-park.html" target="_blank">only one trail</a>, but it stretches 10 km across the entire park so you'll see plenty of Pinery along the way. The family-friendly route is fairly flat and covers a gravel or paved surface with a few gently rolling hills. Therefore, if you've got the energy for it, there's no reason you can't return the same way.   
      </p>
      <p>
        Bikes are available for hire at hourly, daily, or weekly rates at the <a href="https://pinerypark.on.ca/wp_site/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/rentals.pdf" target="_blank">park store</a>.

        River paddling at Pinery National Park
      </h2>
      <p>
        Pinery Provincial Park's Old Ausable Channel is an idyllic place to enjoy a paddle on a lazy afternoon. Flanked by swampy wetland and thickly forested pines, the scenery is superb, and you'll spot an abundance of birdlife en route.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kayaks, canoes, river bikes, paddle boats, and stand up paddleboards are available to rent at the <a href="https://pinerypark.on.ca/wp_site/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/rentals.pdf" target="_blank">park store</a>.   
      </p>

      <h2>
        Fees at Pinery National Park
      </h2>
      <p>
        The park charges a <a href="https://www.ontarioparks.com/fees/dayuse/2019" target="_blank">nominal day-use fee</a> upon entry, which varies depending on numerous factors.
