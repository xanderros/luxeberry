        Picture clear turquoise water, warm radiant weather, and fine golden sands. Sound like a slice of tropical paradise? Not quite. We're talking about Grand Bend's Main Beach; the top beach destination in Canada. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Straddling the shores of Lake Hudson in Southwest Ontario, this picturesque stretch of sand has rapidly reached legendary status. Unmatched natural beauty, a family-friendly vibe, and a serious approach to safety have seen Grand Bend also achieve the coveted Blue Flag acclaim.

      <h2>
        A Blue Flag Beach
      </h2>
      <p>
        Grand Bend's Main Beach is one of just 28 Blue Flag beaches in Canada, so you know it's got to be good.
      </p>
      <p>
        A Blue Flag is an eco-certification from the Foundation for Environmental Education. The prestigious award certifies the beach as exhibiting exceptional standards across four key categories: 
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li class="list__item"><strong>Water Quality:</strong> Blue Flag beaches boast clear and clean water that's free from contaminants. The Grand Bend council continually monitors Main Beach to ensure the water quality exceeds established standards.</li>
        <li class="list__item"><strong>Environmental Management:</strong> Blue Flag beaches operate with environmentally sustainable practices, ensuring the beach remains impeccably clean and the water pollution-free. </li>
        <li class="list__item"><strong>Safety:</strong> Blue Flag beaches must have strict safety procedures in place, including first-aid stations and an emergency response plan. Main Beach has a dedicated lifesaving service from Mid-June to Labour Day (the first week of September).</li>
        <li class="list__item"><strong>Environmental Education:</strong> Blue Flag beaches run educational programs for users to learn practical information on how to conserve the fragile ecosystem. </li>
      </ul>

        Sunsets
      </h2>
      <p>
        National Geographic ranks the sunsets at Grand Bend in the world's top 10. And when you gaze upon this mesmerising technicoloured display for yourself, it's not hard to see why.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every evening during the summer, scores of holidaymakers make their way to the west-facing Main Beach to watch the magic unfold. The evening atmosphere is festive yet family-friendly, and there's a bunch of vibrant restaurants and ice cream parlours to visit nearby.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you'd rather watch the show somewhere more secluded, then head down to the beach at Pinery Provincial Park instead.

        Fishing
      </h2>
      <p>
        Fancy casting a line?  
      </p>
      <p>
        Then head down to the lighthouse pier and join the other anglers at the region's best shore fishing spot. Rainbow, brown, and lake trout are plentiful between spring and fall, and there are enough salmon and walleye to go around as well. Adept fishermen might even reel in a few bass and perch if they're lucky. For a more bountiful catch, hire a charter to whisk you out to the deeper waters in the middle of the lake.  
      </p>
      <p>
        The fishing outlets in town rent out rods and tackle should you forget to bring your own gear. 
      </p>

      <h2>
        Boating
      </h2>
      <p>
        The Marina at the southern tip of the beach hosts a wide range of watercraft, many of which can be chartered or rented out. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Keen sailors can head down River Road to the Grand Bend Yacht Club to launch their trailered vessels.  
      </p>
