        Aside from sunbathing on Main Beach and exploring the Pinery Provincial Park, Grand Bend has become a hot holiday destination for its bourgeoning foodie and retail scene. And the epicentre of these contemporary cosmopolitan pursuits is Main Street.
      </p>
      <p>
        Grand Bend's main drag runs along Main St. W, from Ontario St right down to the shores of the beach. Along this attractive 600-metre stretch are the lion's share of the town's restaurants, shops, tour operators, and bars. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We'll cover the top spots, so you'll know exactly where to go on your trip to Grand Bend.

      <h2>
        Main Street Restaurants and Bars
      </h2>
      <p>
        <strong>The Growling Gator Bar And Grill</strong><br> Located right on the end of Main Street by the beach, Growling Gator is a Grand Bend institution for its hearty North American fare and solid selection of drinks. Grab a table on the outdoor deck to dine alfresco with sweeping views of the lake. It gets pretty rowdy at night during peak season with the party-hearty crowd, so steer clear if that's not your thing. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Midori Sushi Bar</strong><br> Midori plates up tasty Lake Huron sushi in an elegant setting, served either on the outdoor patio or in the well-appointed interior dining hall. All your favourite rolls get made fresh from the catch of the day, ensuring the sushi here is as succulent as they come. Presentation is another strong point at Midori, with each dish adopting a creative contemporary aesthetic. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>The Dairy Dip and Pizza Place</strong><br> Looking to cool off from the scorching Ontario summertime sun? Then make a beeline for Dairy Dip, which whips up the best sundaes and soft ice cream in town. The prices here are pretty reasonable considering the quality of these delectable sugary treats, and you'll find filling savoury delights like poutine and pizza on the menu as well.

        Main Street Shops
      </h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Archies Surf Shop</strong><br> Although Grand Bend isn't exactly a surfy town, that doesn't mean it's not a great place to stock up on the latest Roxy and Rip Curl gear. Archies has been a mainstay on the Main Street retail scene for as far back as we can remember, and it flogs off all the coolest surfy brands at competitive rates. You'll find a whole bunch of regional souvenirs and knick-knacks here as well. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Perfect Image</strong><br> If you're searching for a more permanent souvenir, head to Perfect Image to get a tattoo imprinted on your skin for eternity. Owner and tattooist extraordinaire, Jesse, has become a local legend for his friendly persona and exceptional artwork. Piercings and other gnarly body mods are available.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sea Jewels Trading Company</strong><br> As the best giftware store in town, Sea Jewels sources all sorts of zany knick-knacks from around the world.
